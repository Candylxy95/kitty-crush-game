# Kitty Crush

This is a Browser Game inspired from my childhood favorite: Neopet's "Destruct-O-Match" - but in larger display and adorable cats graphics to zen-click on. This game has been built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Double-click on connecting cats of the same color to clear the cats from the board and earn as many points as possible within a minute.
